      description: "I’m Sasha, and I started Project Party Productions because I noticed something was missing in the world of photo booths. Most of them are fun to look at, but they don’t bring energy or excitement to the party. I wanted to change that. I don’t just operate the booth, I’m part of the entertainment! Every detail is carefully thought out to make sure guests are laughing, having fun, and feeling included. We’re all about giving exceptional value and making sure every event is unforgettable. And we’re fully mobile! Whether it’s an indoor or outdoor wedding, a backyard, a field, the beach, or anywhere there are people ready to have a party, Project Party Productions will be there. I’m bubbly, quirky, and full of energy, and I’m backed by an amazing team that makes every event run smoothly. For us, it’s more than just about photos or 360 videos, it’s about creating an experience that everyone remembers long after the party ends. Because at the end of the day, your celebration deserves more than just a photo booth—it deserves an experience!"

      description: "I'm Vic, and I’ve loved working with people for as long as I can remember, starting out as a camp counselor and swimming instructor, and later spending much of my career supporting individuals with developmental differences. These experiences taught me how to connect with all kinds of people, stay attentive to their needs, and help make ideas come to life. At Project Party Productions, I bring that same care and attention to every event. I make sure every detail is planned, every question is answered, and every client’s vision becomes a reality. Communication is key for me, I’m always listening, coordinating, and staying on top of everything so that guests can just enjoy the moment. Whether it’s a photo booth, a 360 video experience, or a completely customized setup, I’m here to make sure the experience is fun, smooth, and unforgettable."

Being part of a team that turns celebrations into lasting moments is such a privilege, and I can’t wait to keep spreading that same joy at every event we’re a part of."

      description: "I’m Havi and I’m someone who loves adventure. I love trying new things, creating moments to laugh about later, and enjoying life as it comes. Too often we get caught up in the rush of routines and the weight of responsibilities, and we forget that joy is what truly connects us. That’s why I love what I do at Project Party Productions. Our booth is a little reminder that life is best enjoyed when we let ourselves play, be silly, and connect with the people around us. What makes my work special is the interaction I get to have with every single person who steps in front of the camera. Whether it’s sparking a laugh, helping someone who’s camera-shy feel comfortable, or encouraging a group to get a little silly with props, I love being able to provide our guests with a collection of moments that last a lifetime."

      description: "At 24 years old, Matthew brings a wealth of hands-on experience and people-focused skills to every environment he steps into. Starting his career as a swimming instructor and lifeguard, he developed a strong sense of responsibility, attention to detail, and the ability to remain calm under pressure—skills that are invaluable in both safety and event settings. His time as a camp counselor further refined his ability to engage with people from all walks of life, including individuals with disabilities, ensuring everyone felt included, supported, and—most importantly—had a great time. Now working as a welder, Matthew combines precision, discipline, and a strong work ethic with a grounded, team-oriented mindset. His background in high-responsibility roles where safety and enjoyment go hand-in-hand makes him a natural fit for the events industry. Whether helping coordinate logistics or engaging with guests, Matthew brings a unique blend of technical know-how and people skills, making him a reliable and adaptable asset in delivering smooth, safe, and memorable experiences."
